Manage Azure subscriptionshere are multiple ways to obtain an Azure subscription, and a wide range of subscription types (or offers). Some of the cost common types include:
    Free trial
    Pay-As-You-Go/Web Direct
    Visual Studio/MSDN subscriptions
    Microsoft Resellers
    Cloud Solution Provider
    Microsoft Open Licensing
    Enterprise Agreements

The capabilities of each subscription are similar, in that each subscription type allows you to create and manage resources. Some subscription types have restrictions on supported resource types and locations. For example, Visual Studio subscriptions typically do not have a credit card associated with them, which prevents you from purchasing services from the Azure Marketplace, such as network virtual appliances. Visual Studio subscriptions for Azure only have access to a limited number of Azure regions. The regional restrictions for each offer can be viewed at https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/offers/.Azure pass = 30 day code for MOC students, by authorized learning partners onlyMS imagen/for studentsAzure Benefit for MPN = for Microsoft Partner NetworkBizSpark = for startups 

##    assign administrator permissionsportal: Subscription > IAM > +Add
##    configure cost center quotas and taggingYou can monitor costs by resource groups or tagstag with environment and value: billing code for example. and report from there. You can enforce tagging with azure policy. 
##    configure Azure subscription policies at Azure subscription level
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.PolicyInsights'create a new policypolicies on github: https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/New-AzureRMPolicyDefinition. Assign policy (to a scope)
New-AzureRMPolicyAssignment   AZ module: $definition = New-AzPolicyDefinition -Name "{{policyName}}" -DisplayName "{{displayName}}" -description "{{description}}" -Policy 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy-samples/master/samples/{{path}}/azurepolicy.rules.json' -Parameter 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy-samples/master/samples/{{path}}/azurepolicy.parameters.json' -Mode All
$definition
$assignment = New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name <assignmentname> -Scope <scope> -PolicyDefinition $definition
$assignment az policy definition create –-name "{{policyName}}" --display-name "{{displayName}}" --description "{{description}}" --rules 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy-samples/master/samples/{{path}}/azurepolicy.rules.json' –-params 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-policy-samples/master/samples/{{path}}/azurepolicy.parameters.json' -mode All

az policy assignment create --name <assignmentname> --scope <scope> --policy "{{policyName}}" you can scope the whole subscription or a resource group, and even exclude resources in a resource group. 
---Analyze resource utilization and consumption---

##    configure diagnostic settings on resources	##
##    create baseline for resources		##
have each of your resources stored as a script or (ARM) template. you want to modify the template instead of a resource. (desired state configuration)you can create templates with automation script. you can find them in the deployment templatesThe other way is powershell scripts.this is done manually, azure does not generate powershell scripts automatically.##    create and rest alerts	##
    analyze alerts across subscription
    analyze metrics across subscription
    create action groups
    monitor for unused resources
    monitor spend
    report on spend
    utilize Log Search query functions
    view alerts in Log Analytics

Manage resource groups

    use Azure policies for resource groups
    configure resource locks
    configure resource policies
    identify auditing requirements
    implement and set tagging on resource groups
    move resources across resource groups
    remove resource groups

Managed role based access control (RBAC)

    create a custom role
    configure access to Azure resources by assigning roles
    configure management access to Azure, troubleshoot RBAC, implement RBAC policies, assign RBAC Roles
